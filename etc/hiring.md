Hiring a Python developer for web scraping tasks
================================================

Must have demonstrated experience in Scrapy and python-selenium. Upgrading the 
code to use Playwright is acceptable as well.

Problem Description
===================

[Signalstart-analysis](https://github.com/metaperl/signalstart-analysis/tree/master) is a Python program with two major parts:
1. a Python web scraper that visits the overview and detail pages at SignalStart to collect data on forex signal providers
2. a visualization front-end that takes a CSV file and renders it. The front-end is a Javascript rendering package that I simply downloaded and used. I do not know Javascript and you are not expected to either. However, you should be able to insure that the output CSV from step 1 can be digested and rendered by the Javascript-based front-end. Conversion/upgrade of the front-end is possible but not expected.
